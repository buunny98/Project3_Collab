            <h3 class="logoCob"> Project Process Analysis 1 (Website Design For A Cake Shop:)</h3> <br>

            <p class="paraPara2">Designing a website for a customized cake shop is always fun. I was creating a project
                which
                involved building a website for a cake shop. The name of the shop was Shyama’s cake Design. In the
                beginning, I started off with a style guide that had all my elements ready to go for my final version of
                the
                website, for example, font, text-elements, button designs etc.
            </p><br>

            <figure>

                <img src="img/img3.png" alt="Style Guide">
                <figcaption> <strong>(Rough Style Guide for a Webiste Design)</strong>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p class="paraPara2">I went with a much soft look for the website light colours, serif fonts and center
                alignment
                of the text. I wanted to make my website look more informative rather than throwing pictures all over my
                website.

                After building my style guide I went on and started building the website. While making the website I
                realized keeping only the pink colour on the whole website made the website look less punchy and
                contrasty
                to the user. I ended up adding the Navy-blue colour for the navigation bar on the website. I also wanted
                to
                make the home page look animative so I ended up adding a gif which made the website look more versatile.
                There were a couple of challenges that I had to face while designing and making the website, the website
                had
                a lot of buttons, labels & textarea’s for the user to suggest what kind of cake the user wants, making
                the
                website responsive with those labels and buttons was a huge challenge. Every time I made the screen
                smaller
                than 300px the labels and buttons went off the screen. In the end, I was able to fix those by adding a
                lot
                of media queries on the buttons for every 50px I added one query to make the button and label smaller so
                that it does not go outside of the window. After all that effort, the end result was great and the
                website
                was looking CakeElicious.<br>

            <h3 class="logoCob"> Project Process Analysis 2 (Website Database with PHP and MySql)</h3> <br>

            <p class="paraPara2">Making sessions and database for a website is always fun. ISN’T IT? Okie, I know it has
                a
                lot of challenges even a small type of error can mess up the whole database especially when there is a
                lot
                of data involved but the end result is always satisfying and great. Similarly, I made a website for a
                Hotel
                Listing Company named StayComfortzz and I made a SQL database to store all the data for the user’s
                computer
                and from the hotel listings. I started off with making the wireframe of the website which is not
                challenges
                it involved an HTML and CSS mostly, I did not involve a lot of javaScript in that because the website
                had to
                be simple and not much fancy, the animation could be fixed and worked on afterwards, the database was
                the
                important thing.
            </p><br>

                <img src="img/img4.png" alt="Style Guide">
                <figcaption> <strong>(Website Design)</strong>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="paraPara2">After building the wireframe I had to add the PHP coding and that was fun. I also
                created
                login sessions by adding cookies on the website which allowed two different views one for the Member and
                one
                view was for the normal visiter user on the website. I also had to face some challenges while making the
                website, the XAMPP control panel and control were very slow on my computer to display changes on the
                website
                and database, I had some challenges while figuring that problem out, turns out my Google Chrome had
                stored a
                lot of cookies so it was taking a lot of time to display changes on the browser. But in the end, I was
                able
                to fix that by wiping out all the cookies from the chrome. AT last, the database was created
                successfully
                and it was working great. Overall this was one of the challenging projects that I have worked on but it
                was
                a lot of fun at the same time.
